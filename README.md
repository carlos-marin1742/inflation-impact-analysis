#  Inflation Impact Analysis Using Python

## Background

Inflation affects purchasing power, savings, investment, and international currency values. In open economies like India and the U.S., inflation often influences exchange rates, especially when analyzed through macroeconomic theories such as Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). 




## Business Problem

Understanding how inflation impacts the INR/USD exchange rate can help economists, policymakers, and financial analysts make informed decisions regarding currency valuation, monetary policy, and cross-border investments.



## Methods
- Collected historical inflation and exchange rate data for India and the U.S. (1980â€“2024).

- Cleaned and merged datasets to enable year-by-year comparison.

- Visualized trends using line plots for inflation rates and exchange rates.

- Conducted correlation analysis to identify statistical relationships.

- Applied the PPP formula to compute expected exchange rates based on inflation differentials.

- Compared actual vs. expected exchange rates to assess PPP validity and uncover anomalies.


## Results
- Weak negative correlation between India's inflation and INR/USD exchange rate (-0.34).

- Weak positive correlation between U.S. inflation and the exchange rate (0.24).

- PPP-based expected exchange rate showed a steeper depreciation of INR than actual data suggested.

- Significant deviations between actual and expected rates indicate additional influencing factors.



## Conclusions / Summary of Findings

Inflation rates in both India and the U.S. influence the INR/USD exchange rate, but not in isolation. While the PPP theory explains some long-term trends, actual exchange rate movements are also shaped by broader economic variables such as monetary policy, trade flows, and market sentiment.
